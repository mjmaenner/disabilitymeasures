**Type of Measure:**  "Detecting faux pas is a skill normally acquired by age 9-11. However, children with high-functioning autism or aspergers syndrome are impaired on this task. In adulthood, adults with damage to the orbito-frontal cortex and those with some forms of dementia are also impaired on this task."
"20 short stories containing incidents of faux pas (someone mistakenly saying something they shouldn't have) are read to the individual, who is then asked questions to determine whether or not they recognised the faux pas."

"In this test, the subject is read 10 stories that contain a social faux pas and 10 control stories that contain a minor conflict, but in which no faux pas has is committed. This is a methodological improvement over the version of the task used previously. The text of each story is also placed in front of the subject so that it may be referred to, thereby reducing the demands made on working memory. After each story, the subject is asked if anyone said something that they should not have said, i.e. to identify correctly the stories containing a faux pas. If a faux pas is identified, two clarifying questions are asked: "why shouldn't they have said what they did?' and 'why do you think they did say it?'. In order to comprehend that a faux pas has occurred, the subject has to understand two mental states: namely that they person making the faux pas does not, at that moment, know that they should not say it; and that the person hearing it would be upset or hurt to discover the informant. In the control stories, no faux pas is committed but all of the same questions are asked of the subject. In all stories, regardless of the subject's answer to the first question, non ToM based memory questions are asked to assess the subject's story comprehension."
