**Type of Measure:** The Functional Communication Classification System was designed to classify how children between the ages of four and five communicate on a daily basis. The tool specifically focuses on what children can do, instead of what they can’t. There are five levels a child can be categorized in: (1) effective communicator in most situations (2) effective communicator in most situations, but does need some help (3) an effective communicator in most situations and can communicate small ranges of messages and topics to the most familiar people (4) Assistance is required in most situations, especially with unfamiliar people and environments and communicates daily needs and wants (5) communicates unintentionally with others, using behavior and movement. 
 
**Target Population:** Children between the ages of 4 and 5

**Measurement properties and previous use:** [Barty et. al](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/dmcn.13124/suppinfo) states that the FFCS is useful for CP because it presents a comprehensive overview of the problem characterizing communication and the tool is useful in considering speech, language, and communication in children with CP. Overall interrater reliability was excellent and kappa values were 0.94 between speech-language pathologists (SLP) and other allied health professionals (AHP), 069 between SLP’s and parents, and 0.60 between AHP’s and parents.
