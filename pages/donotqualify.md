Because it can be challenging to even find out which measures are freely available, we are providing a list of measures that did not meet our [inclusion criteria](http://disabilitymeasures.org/criteria), (usually because they are available under a proprietary license).

If you believe that one of these measures does actually meet our criteria, please [let us know!](http://disabilitymeasures.org/contact)
