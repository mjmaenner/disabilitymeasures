**Type of Measure:**  The Adult Repetitive Behaviour Questionnaire-2 (RBQ-2A) is a 20-item self-report questionnaire that is based on items from the Diagnostic Interview for Social and Communication Disorders. The RBQ-2A measures restricted and repetitive behaviours such as routines and rituals, repetitive motor behaviours, sensory interests, and repetitive actions with objects. It is suitable for adults and only accessible to those with sufficient cognitive resources and verbal ability.    

**Target Population:** Adults (18 years and older)

**Measurement properties and previous use:** The psychometric properties of this evaulation tool were examined among university students in the UK and adults in Australia [(Barrett et al., 2015)](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10803-015-2514-6/fulltext.html). Results from a Principle Components Analysis suggest a two-factor structure -- motor behaviors (coefficient alpha = 0.79) and preference for for sameness (coefficient alpha = 0.83). The RBQ-2A is a relatively new measure, but the developers assert that the RBQ-2A is a useful self-report measure of repetitive and restrictive behaviors in adults and reportedly discriminates between adults with Autism Spectrum Disorder and neurotypical individuals.

**Licence:** [via Cardiff University](https://sites.cardiff.ac.uk/rbq2a/download/) You must use the RBQ-2A as it is, without changing any of the items, the order of the items, or the response scales. The RBQ2-A should be comparable across studies and settings. You must agree not to change the wording of questions, add questions, or administer only subsets of questions. The RBQ-2A is free to use, but users must acknowledge the sponsors in any publication using the appropriate citation (i.e. Baker et al., 2015).
