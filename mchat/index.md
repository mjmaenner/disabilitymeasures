**Type of Measure:**  The Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (M-CHAT™) is a developmental screening instrument intended to identify children at risk for autism and other developmental delays.  The MCHAT-Revised with follow-up (MCHAT-R/F) was released in 2013 and is the version [recommended by the authors.](http://www.mchatscreen.com/Official_M-CHAT_Website.html)

**Target Population:** Children aged 16 to 30 months.

**Measurement properties and previous use:**  The M-CHAT™ is widely used in research and for developmental screening.  The [initial study](https://m-chat.org/_references/robins_jadd01.pdf) to evaluate the M-CHAT™ reported a sensitivity of 0.87, specificity of 0.99 and positive predictive value of 0.80.

[A study in Pediatrics](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2013/12/18/peds.2013-1813.abstract) reports: "The reliability and validity of the M-CHAT-R/F were demonstrated, and optimal scoring was determined by using receiver operating characteristic curves. Children whose total score was ≥3 initially and ≥2 after follow-up had a 47.5% risk of being diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD; confidence interval [95% CI]: 0.41–0.54) and a 94.6% risk of any developmental delay or concern (95% CI: 0.92–0.98). Total score was more effective than alternative scores. An algorithm based on 3 risk levels is recommended to maximize clinical utility and to reduce age of diagnosis and onset of early intervention. The M-CHAT-R detects ASD at a higher rate compared with the M-CHAT while also reducing the number of children needing the follow-up. Children in the current study were diagnosed 2 years younger than the national median age of diagnosis."
