**Type of Measure:**  [excerpted from a recent summary paper](http://www.molecularautism.com/content/6/1/2)  A self-report measure of autistic traits. The AQ has 50 items, which are divided into five subscales consisting of 10 items each that assess domains of cognitive strengths and difficulties related to ASC: communication, social skills, imagination, attention to detail and attention switching.

**Target Population:** There are specific versions for children, adolescents, and adults. 

**Measurement properties and previous use:** [From review of 73 studies (by the authors of the AQ)](http://www.molecularautism.com/content/6/1/2) Studies tend to show that AQ scores are elevated in individuals with autism. The original AQ validationstudy found that the total AQ score and its five subscale scores are normally distributed and have demonstrated good test-retest reliability, good internal consistency, and that the measure has acceptably high sensitivity and specificity: at a cut-off score of 26, 83% of patients were correctly identified (sensitivity 0.95, specificity 0.52, positive predictive value 0.84, negative predictive value 0.78), while a cut-off score of 32 correctly identifies 76% of patients (sensitivity 0.77, specificity 0.74) when the AQ is used in a referred clinical sample.

Other studies suggest report that the AQ had a weak or no correlation to other measures of autism. [Bishop and Mailick](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3475727/) [Brugha et al](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21798110)

**Languages:** developed in English, translated into multiple languages, but availability varies by the specific version (child, adolescent adult, AQ vs AQ-10)
