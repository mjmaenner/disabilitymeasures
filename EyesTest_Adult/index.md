**Type of Measure:** There are few tests that can measure if an adult with normal intelligence may have mild deficits in social understanding. In neurodevelopmental conditions, such as Autism Spectrum Disorders, deficits in social cognitition may be camoflauged as a result of learning compensatory strategies. It is therefore crucial to identify and develop an adult test of social sensitivity, which was address by [Baron-Cohen, Jolliffe, Mortimore, and Robertson (1997)](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1469-7610.1997.tb01599.x/full) via the "Reading the Mind in the Eyes" Test - Revised (Eyes Test). 

In this test, participants are presented with a series of 36 photographs of the eye-region of the face of different actors and actresses, and they are asked to choose which of two words best describes what the person is thinking or feeling. The Eyes Task involves theory of mind skills in the sense that the subject has to understand mental state terms and match them to faces (or parts of faces, in this case). This test was conceived as a test of how well participants can put themselves into the mind of a person, and "tune in" to their mental state. Participants are provided with a glossary of words and must effectively distiguinsh the correct target word from three close imposters on each trial.
