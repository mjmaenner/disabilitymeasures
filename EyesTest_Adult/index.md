**Type of Measure:** There are few tests that can measure if an adult with normal intelligence may have mild deficits in social understanding. In neurodevelopmental conditions, such as Autism Spectrum Disorders, deficits in social cognitition may be camoflauged as a result of learning compensatory strategies. It is therefore crucial to identify and develop an adult test of social sensitivity, which was address by [Baron-Cohen, Jolliffe, Mortimore, and Robertson (1997)](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1469-7610.1997.tb01599.x/full) via the "Reading the Mind in the Eyes" Test - Revised (Eyes Test). 

In this test, participants are presented with a series of 36 photographs of the eye-region of the face of different actors and actresses, and they are asked to choose which of two words best describes what the person is thinking or feeling. The Eyes Task involves theory of mind skills in the sense that the subject has to understand mental state terms and match them to faces (or parts of faces, in this case). This test was conceived as a test of how well participants can put themselves into the mind of a person, and "tune in" to their mental state. Participants are provided with a glossary of words and must effectively distiguinsh the correct target word from three close imposters on each trial.       

**Target Population:** Adults with normal intelligence

**Measurement properties and previous use:** The original version of the Eyes Test was validated 

"In the study reported below, 3 groups of subjects were compared on the Eyes Task:
adults with autism or AS, normal adults, and a clinical control group, adults with
Tourette Syndrome (TS). The latter was chosen because of the following similarities
between autism, AS, and TS: (i) they all had intelligence in the normal range; (ii) they
had all suffered from a developmental disorder since childhood; (iii) these disorders all
cause disruptions to both normal schooling, and normal peer relations; (iv) these
disorders are also all postulated to involve frontal abnormalities (Bishop, 1992; Baron-
Cohen, Robertson, & Moriarty, 1994; Baron-Cohen et al, 1994); (v) and all have a
sizeable genetic aetiology (Robertson, 1994; Bolton & Rutter, 1990). (vi) These disorders
also all affect males more than females"

"Group 1 comprised 16 subjects with high functioning autism (HFA) or AS (4 with highfunctioning
autism and 12 with AS). The sex ratio was 13:3 (m:f)."

"Group 2 comprised 50 normal age matched adults (25 male and 25 female), drawn from
the general population of Cambridge (excluding members of the University), all of whom
had no history of any psychiatric condition (as established by self-report).They were
selected randomly from the subject panel held in the University Department."

"Group 3 comprised 10 adult patients with Tourette Syndrome (TS), also age matched
with Groups 1 and 2. The sex ratio was 8:2 (m:f), thus mirroring the ratio in Group
1.They were attending a tertiary referral centre in London, and had all been diagnosed by
a leading expert in the field of TS (Dr Mary Robertson), on the basis of meeting DSM-IV
criteria for TS."

"The Eyes Task is designed to be a ‘pure’ theory of mind test, at an advanced level. This is
because, as far as we can see, the test itself involves no executive function component
(no attention switching, inhibition, planning, etc., cf Russell, Mauthner, Sharpe, &
Tidswell, 1991; Ozonoff et al, 1991) and no central coherence component (since there is
little contextual information available, cf Frith, 1989). This is not to say that such
processes may not play a role in the development of a theory of mind - only that the task
itself has no planning or context component. As mentioned earlier, in order to validate
the Eyes Task as a theory of mind task, subjects in the two clinical groups were also
tested on Happé’s (1994a) Strange Stories. In the case of the subjects with autism and
AS, this was part of a separate study (Jolliffe, 1997). If the Eyes Task was indeed
tapping theory of mind, then performance on the Eyes Task should correlate with
performance on Happé’s strange stories."

"Finally, in order to check whether deficits on the Eyes Task were due to other factors, we
administered two control tasks to the subjects in Group 1. (Gender Recognition Task and Basic Emotion Recognition Task)"

"This study tested several predictions. First, that adults with autism or Asperger Syndrome
(AS), despite being of normal or above average IQ, would nevertheless be impaired on a
subtle theory of mind test. This prediction was confirmed. Secondly, that within the
normal population, females would be significantly better on this test of theory of mind
than males. This was also confirmed."

"We interpret the results as providing experimental evidence for subtle theory of mind
deficits in individuals with autism or AS, at later points in development and at higher
points on the IQ continuum than has been previously demonstrated. The justification that
the Eyes Task is indeed measuring theory of mind comes from four sources. First, the
target words are mental state terms. Secondly, these are not just emotion terms, but
include terms describing cognitive mental states. This is therefore more than just an
emotion perception test. Thirdly, the pattern of results from the Eyes Task mirrored the
pattern of performance on the Happé Strange Stories - an existing advanced theory of
mind task. Finally, the deficit on the Eyes Task was not mirrored on the two control
tasks, suggesting that the poor performance by subjects with autism or AS was not due to
the stimuli being eyes, or to a deficit in extracting social information from minimal cues,
or to a subtle perceptual deficit, or to basic emotion recognition." (1997 study)


(2001 study)
"The Revised Eyes Test was administered to a group of adults with AS or HFA (N=15) and again discriminated these from a large number of controls (N=239) drawn from different samples. 

"This study reports normative data on the Revised Eyes Test for adults. The modification were designed to render this test a more sensitive measure of adult social intelligence. As was hoped, the modifications from the origincal version led to normal performance being significantly below ceiling. This is important if the test is to do more than discriminate extreme performance and instead detect meaningful individual differences. This study replicated the earlier finding that adults with AS or HFA are significantly impaired on such tests, whereas they are not impaired on the gender recognition control test. his therefore validates it as a useful test with which to identify subtle impairments in social intelligence in otherwise normally intelligent adults with AS/HFA from controls."

"There was no significant correlation between IQ and the Eyes Test suggesting this is independent of general (nonsocial) intelligence. [In both samples ]Performance on the Eyes Test was inversely correlated with performance on the Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ), suggesting that both measure degrees of autistic traits across the notional spectrum. The AQ is not diagnostic but may serve as a useful instrument for quantifying the extent of an individual's caseness in terms of AS/HFA, measuring personality traits. The present results confirm our earlier finding that adults with HFA or AS score significantly higher on the AQ than do general population controls."
