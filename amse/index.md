**Type of Measure:**  [quoting their [first paper](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21519955)]  The Autism Mental Status Examination (AMSE) is an eight-item observational assessment that prompts the observation and recording of signs and symptoms of autism spectrum disorders (ASD). The AMSE is intended to take place seamlessly in the context of a clinical exam and produces a total score.  [quoting their [second paper](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23989909)]: The AMSEâ€™s intended use is for clinicians with competence in ASD diagnosis who do not have the capacity to administer standardized observational assessments.  

**Target Population:** High-risk ASD populations of all ages. Their first study included individuals from 18 months to 38 years. A subsequent study found good performance among verbally fluent adults.  

**Measurement properties and previous use:** The AMSE shows a strong ability to discriminate between individuals that do and do not have ASD.  AMSE classifications have been compared to ADOS scores and also best-estimate clinical diagnoses.  In high-risk samples, the AMSE shows good sensitivity, specificity, and high positive predictive value. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve ranged from 0.89 to 0.97 depending on whether it was compared to clinical diagnoses or ADOS classifciations.  

**Languages:**  English is available now. Translations to other languages are in progress.
