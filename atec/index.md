**Type of Measure:**  The Autism Treatment and Evaluation Checklist is a one page form designed to be completed by parents, teachers, or caretakers. There are a total of 77 items categorized within 4 subtests: 1 speech/language communication (14 items); 2 Sociability (20 items); 3 Sensory/Cognitive Awareness (18 items); and 4 Health/Physical/Behavior (25 items). This tool is not a diagnostic checklist, but instead provides subscale scores and a total score to be used for comparison at a later date. The lower the score, the less cause for concern. This tool is different from other diagnostic instruments because it measures the effect of treatment, as opposed to diagnosing autism

**Target Population:** Children and Adults

**Measurement properties and previous use:** There have been several studies that have evaluated the attributes of ATEC and compared them to other diagnostic tools. One study exemplified that ATEC is useful in understanding physical issues in ASD, such as sleep problems, seizures, gastrointestinal issues, etc. ATEC is able to quantitatively assess these issues. Additionally ATEC is relatively simple to administer, easy to understand, and can be filled out by a parent within 15 minutes and scored using the Autism Research Institute (ARI) website [Gier et. al., 2013](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3725669/). 

**Languages:** Checklist created in English, but can be translated online in Chinese (simplified), Spanish, French, Italian, Turkish, Portuguese, German, Persian, Hebrew, Serbian, Dutch, Albanian, Bosnian, Czech, Estonian, Arabic, Romanian (click select another language on top)
