**Type of Measure:**  Parent's Observations of Social Interaction (POSI) is one component of the Survey of Wellbeing of Young Children (SWYC) that was designed to detect Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). It is a 7-item screening tool that was developed from the Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers ([M-CHAT](http://disabilitymeasures.org/m-chat/)).       

**Target Population:** Children ages 16-18 months

**Measurement properties and previous use:** The validity and reliability of the POSI was evaluated by [Smith, Sheldrick, Perrin (2013)](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/imhj.21356/full), who assessed internal consistency, concurrent validity, specificity, and sensitivity across two studies. In Study 1, scores on the POSI and M-CHAT were compared against the results of a clinical ASD evaluation in a sample of 217 children (18-48 months). Findings indicated that the POSI's sensitivity (89%) was higher than that of the M-CHAT (71%), but that the specificities were comparable (POSI-54%; M-CHAT-62%). In Study 2, the scores of 232 children (16-36 months) were examined, and findings indicated that the POSI had significantly higher sensitivity than the M-CHAT (83% vs 50%), but lower specificity (75% vs 84%). Internal consistency was acceptable in both studies (0.83 and 0.86, respectively).
