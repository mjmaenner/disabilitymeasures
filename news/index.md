### We've moved (here)!
June 2015  

We are now using [github pages](https://www.pages.github.com). The site should look a little nicer and load a *lot* faster than before.  Most importantly, the entire website is now open source. Everyone is free to examine, copy, or suggest edits to the site via [this repository](https://www.github.com/mjmaenner/disabilitymeasures.org/tree/gh-pages).

Thanks to Karl Broman for his [simple site](https://www.kbroman.org/simple_site) tutorial, which was a huge help.

### DisabilityMeasures.org mentioned in SFARI news article!
