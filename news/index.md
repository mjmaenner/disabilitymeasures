### We've moved (to here)!
June 2015  

We are now using [github pages](https://pages.github.com). The site should look a little nicer and load a *lot* faster than before.  Most importantly, the entire website is now open source. Everyone is free to examine, copy, or suggest edits to the site via [this repository](https://www.github.com/mjmaenner/disabilitymeasures/tree/gh-pages).

Thanks to Karl Broman for his [simple site](https://www.kbroman.org/simple_site) tutorial, which was a huge help.

### DisabilityMeasures.org mentioned in SFARI news article!
September 2013

A bit slow to post this, but we were mentioned in an article by Sarah DeWeerdt about improving the availability autism diagnostic tools on the SFARI news site. The article gives a great overview of the situation and the problems with proprietary tools; it was later republished at Scientific American.

And in general site news, we'll be adding more measures soon.
