### We've moved!
June 2015
We are now running disabilitymeasures.org using [github pages](www.pages.github.com). The site should look a little nicer and load a *lot* faster.  Most importantly, the entire website is now open source. Everyone is free to examine, copy, or suggest edits to the site via [this repository](www.github.com/mjmaenner/disabilitymeasures.org/tree/gh-pages).

Thanks to Karl Broman for his [simple site](www.kbroman.org/simple_site) tutorial, which was a huge help.
