**Type of Measure:** The Children’s Scale of Hostility and Aggression: Reactive/Proactive (C-SHARP) is an instrument for measuring aggressive and hostile behavior in children with developmental disabilities.

**Target Population:** Children with Intellectual or Developmental Disabilities

**Measurement properties and previous use:** The reliability and validity of the Children's Scale of Hostility and Aggression: Reactive/Proactive (C-SHARP) was assessed through data from a survey of 365 children with I/DD aged 3–21 years. Interrater reliability was very high for the Problem Scale, which characterizes type of aggression. Reliability was lower but largely acceptable for the Provocation Scale, which assesses motivation. The Provocation Scale, which categorizes behavior as proactive or reactive, showed expected differences in children with DBD, but was less effective in those with ADHD. Overall, the C-SHARP has sound psychometrics with some areas of weakness that can be assessed through further research [Farmer, C. & Aman, M, 2010](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0891422209001589).
