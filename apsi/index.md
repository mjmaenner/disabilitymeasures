**Type of Measure:** The Autism Parenting Stress Index (APSI) is tool is a measure of parental stress as perceived by parents/guardians of young children with autism. If reflects the physical, social, and communication barriers imposed by the disability. As such, the items on this test fall into three categories: the core social disability, difficult-to-manage behavior, and physical issues. The test is designed to indicate how much stress parents are experiencing and what factors are causing this stress.

**Target Population:** Parents/caregivers of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder

**Measurement properties and previous use:** Validity of this tool was established through a study with 274 children under the age of six with a Cronbach’s alpha of .827. An exploratory factor analysis suggested three factors impacting parenting stress: one relating to core deficits, one to co-morbid behavioral symptoms, and one to co-morbid physical symptoms.
