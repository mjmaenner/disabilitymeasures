**Type of Measure:**  According to the empathizing-systemizing theory (E-S theory), there are individual differences in the wiring of the brain that result in two different modes a person may process information: empathizing and systemizing. Empathizing is the drive to identify another person’s emotions and thoughts and to respond to these with an appropriate emotion. Systemizing, however, is the drive to analyse the variables in a system and to derive the underlying rules that govern the behaviour of a system. Systemizing also refers to the drive to construct systems. Systemizing allows you to predict the behaviour of a system, and to control it. Persons with Autism Spectrum Disorders are believed to have less ability to empathize and be more systemizing than the general population [(Baron-Cohen, Richler, Bisarya, Gurunathan, & Wheelwright, 2003)](http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/royptb/358/1430/361.full.pdf). The Systemizing Quotient (SQ) was then designed to test the E-S theory. 

The SQ was designed to be short, easy to complete, and easy to score. The SQ is self administered comprises 60 forced-choice format questions, 40 assessing systemizing and 20 filler (control) items. Approximately half the items were worded to produce a ‘disagree’ and half an ‘agree’, for the systemizing response. This was to avoid a response bias either way. Following this, items were randomized. An individual scores two points if they strongly display a systemizing response and one point if they slightly display a systemizing response. There are 20 filler items (items 2, 3, 8, 9, 10, 14, 16, 17, 21, 22, 27, 36, 39, 46, 47, 50, 52, 54, 58, 59), randomly interspersed throughout the SQ, to distract the participant from a relentless focus on systemizing. These questions are not scored at all. 

Items reflect examples from everyday life in which systemizing could be used to varying degrees. The assumption is that a strong systemizer would be drawn to use their systemizing skills across the range of examples more often than a poor systemizer, and would consequently score higher on the SQ. 

**Target Population:** Adults with normal intelligence

**Measurement properties and previous use:** According to the E–S theory, individuals in whom empathizing is more developed than systemizing are referred to as type E. Individuals in whom systemizing is more developed than empathizing are called type S. Individuals in whom systemizing and empathizing are both equally developed are called type B (to indicate the ‘balanced’ brain). Individuals whose systemizing is normal or even hyperdeveloped but whose empathizing is hypodeveloped are an extreme of type S. That is, they may be talented systemizers but at the same time, they may be ‘mind-blind’ (Baron-Cohen 1995). We test if individuals on the autistic spectrum fit the profile of having an extreme of type S. Finally, we postulate the existence of a brain of extreme type E: people who have normal or even hyperdeveloped empathizing skills, whereas their systemizing is hypodeveloped—they may be ‘system-blind’.

people with AS/HFA
scored significantly higher on the SQ, and significantly
lower on the EQ, compared with matched controls.

In Study
1, we measured the SQ of n = 278 adults (114 males, 164 females) from a general population, to test for
predicted sex differences (male superiority) in systemizing. All subjects were also given the Empathy
Quotient (EQ) to test if previous reports of female superiority would be replicated. In Study 2 we employed
the SQ and the EQ with n = 47 adults (33 males, 14 females) with Asperger syndrome (AS) or highfunctioning
autism (HFA), who are predicted to be either normal or superior at systemizing, but impaired
at empathizing. Their scores were compared with n = 47 matched adults from the general population in
Study 1. In Study 1, as predicted, normal adult males scored significantly higher than females on the SQ
and significantly lower on the EQ. In Study 2, again as predicted, adults with AS/HFA scored significantly
higher on the SQ than matched controls, and significantly lower on the EQ than matched controls. The
SQ reveals both a sex difference in systemizing in the general population and an unusually strong drive
to systemize in AS/HFA.
