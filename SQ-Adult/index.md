**Type of Measure:**  According to the empathizing-systemizing theory (E-S theory), there are individual differences in the wiring of the brain that result in two different modes a person may process information: empathizing and systemizing. Empathizing is the drive to identify another person’s emotions and thoughts and to respond to these with an appropriate emotion. Systemizing, however, is the drive to analyse the variables in a system and to derive the underlying rules that govern the behaviour of a system. Systemizing also refers to the drive to construct systems. Systemizing allows you to predict the behaviour of a system, and to control it. Persons with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are believed to have less ability to empathize and be more systemizing than the general population [(Baron-Cohen, Richler, Bisarya, Gurunathan, & Wheelwright, 2003)](http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/royptb/358/1430/361.full.pdf). The Systemizing Quotient (SQ) was then designed to test the E-S theory. 

The SQ was designed to be short, easy to complete, and easy to score. The SQ is self administered comprises 60 forced-choice format questions, 40 assessing systemizing and 20 filler (control) items. Approximately half the items were worded to produce a ‘disagree’ and half an ‘agree’, for the systemizing response. This was to avoid a response bias either way. Following this, items were randomized. An individual scores two points if they strongly display a systemizing response and one point if they slightly display a systemizing response. There are 20 filler items (items 2, 3, 8, 9, 10, 14, 16, 17, 21, 22, 27, 36, 39, 46, 47, 50, 52, 54, 58, 59), randomly interspersed throughout the SQ, to distract the participant from a relentless focus on systemizing. These questions are not scored at all. 

Items reflect examples from everyday life in which systemizing could be used to varying degrees. The assumption is that a strong systemizer would be drawn to use their systemizing skills across the range of examples more often than a poor systemizer, and would consequently score higher on the SQ. 

**Target Population:** Adults with normal intelligence

**Measurement properties and previous use:** During intial test development, [Baron-Cohen and Wheelwright (2004)](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/B:JADD.0000022607.19833.00) assessed differences in systemizing for males and females, and among individuals with and without ASD. People with ASD scored significantly lower on the SQ than the 

people with AS/HFA
scored significantly higher on the SQ, and significantly
lower on the EQ, compared with matched controls.

(from original study - Baron-Cohe et al. 2003)
In Study
1, we measured the SQ of n = 278 adults (114 males, 164 females) from a general population, to test for
predicted sex differences (male superiority) in systemizing. All subjects were also given the Empathy
Quotient (EQ) to test if previous reports of female superiority would be replicated. In Study 2 we employed
the SQ and the EQ with n = 47 adults (33 males, 14 females) with Asperger syndrome (AS) or highfunctioning
autism (HFA), who are predicted to be either normal or superior at systemizing, but impaired
at empathizing. Their scores were compared with n = 47 matched adults from the general population in
Study 1. In Study 1, as predicted, normal adult males scored significantly higher than females on the SQ
and significantly lower on the EQ. In Study 2, again as predicted, adults with AS/HFA scored significantly
higher on the SQ than matched controls, and significantly lower on the EQ than matched controls. The
SQ reveals both a sex difference in systemizing in the general population and an unusually strong drive
to systemize in AS/HFA.

(from Baron-Cohen & Wheelwright, 2004) 
we employed the EQ with n = 90 adults
(65 males, 25 females) with Asperger Syndrome (AS) or high-functioning autism (HFA), who
are reported clinically to have difficulties in empathy. The adults with AS/HFA scored significantly
lower on the EQ than n = 90 (65 males, 25 females) age-matched controls. Of the adults
with AS/HFA, 81% scored equal to or fewer than 30 points out of 80, compared with only 12%
of controls. In Study 2 we carried out a study of n = 197 adults from a general population, to
test for previously reported sex differences (female superiority) in empathy. This confirmed that
women scored significantly higher than men. The EQ reveals both a sex difference in empathy
in the general population and an empathy deficit in AS/HFA.

(From Ling et al. 2009)
Completed questionnaires were collected from 71 males and 95 females.

Participants showed the expected sex difference; the male mean was 30.02 with a SD of 8.6 and the female mean was 21.8 (SD: 8.51). This aggregate score was significantly different (t=6.13, df=164, p<.0005) with an effect size of .96. The effect size for gender is slightly higher than that of d=.82 found by Wakabayashi et al. (2006) or d=.74 found by Baron-Cohen et al. (2003). Males scored significantly higher at p<.05 on 16 of the 40 items. Although females scored higher on 11 items, none of these differences were significant at p<.05 on any item. The item on which females scored most strongly was ‘When I learn a language I become intrigued by its grammatical rules’ (t=−1.78, df=162.91, p=.077).

Reliability analysis showed that the 40-item SQ scale had a reasonable Cronbach's α of .797. However, eight items had corrected item-total correlations of less than .2, and the removal of three items would have improved the Cronbach's α to .811. If we continue to remove items until the Cronbach's alpha would go down we would produce a 30 item scale with an α of .815. This suggests the possibility that a number of the items on the SQ scale are not measuring the same construct.


(Study 2)
The purpose of the study was to evaluate the possible models of the factor structure of systemizing on a new sample from the same population as Study 1.

The participants showed a sex difference in the expected direction on the full 40-item scale with male mean 32.1 with SD 10.39 and a female mean of 22.54 (SD: 8.49). The aggregate score on SQ was significantly different (t=6.5, df=165, p<.0005) with an effect size of d=1.01. Male participants scored significantly higher at the .05 level on 18 of the 40 items. On this occasion females scored significantly higher on one item ‘When I learn a language I become intrigued by its grammatical rules.’ (t=-2.5, df=160.11, p=.013).

Reliability analysis shows that the 40 item scale would have an acceptable Cronbach's α of .83.

In sum, our exploratory analyses in Study 1, confirmatory analysis in Study 2 and analysis using some of Wakabayashi et al.'s (2006) findings and factor structure suggest that SQ is best considered as a four-factor 18-item scale, with subscales measuring topography (map reading etc), technicity (an interest in technical information), DIY, and structure (an interest in discovering the structure of things). The taxonomic items in the SQ do not convincingly show a sex difference but there is some evidence that they could form a subscale of their own. Of the four subscales, technicity shows the strongest sex difference and structure the weakest; DIY and topography have the highest loadings on to a higher order factor of Systemizing. Furthermore, as the 18-item scale was specified in precisely the same fashion as the 18-item model in Study 1, this serves as a replication of the four-factor solution for the 18-item subset.
