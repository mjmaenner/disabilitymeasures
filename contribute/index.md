### We need your help
It takes a lot of effort to find out what measures are out there, which ones are free, and how to get them--it's why we made disabilitymeasures.org.  We welcome help in several areas: 

#### There's a measure that we should include
If there's a freely-available measure that isn't currently listed (and not on the list of measures that don't qualify), please tell us.  In short, we want to include any measure that is:  
  1.  Available under a free-to-use license  
  2.  Accessible on the internet with minimal hassle  
  3.  Relevant to disability   
  4.  Used or evaluated in peer-reviewed study or respectable technical report/white paper  

If you have a measure in mind that fits the [inclusion criteria](https://mjmaenner.github.io/disabilitymeasures/criteria), there are three ways to tell us:  
*  (best option) Create the page yourself on [github](https://github.com/mjmaenner/disabilitymeasures). Each measure has its own sub-folder, and you can use [generic_measure.md](https://github.com/mjmaenner/disabilitymeasures/blob/gh-pages/generic_measure.md) as a template 
*  Fill out this [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1t1tDr09eW1zcmMjHf5aa6-RcL7hlP4a2kAlKh82ZnA8/viewform) to the best of your knowledge. We can't post it if we don't have enough information to know that it qualifies.
*  [email us](https://mjmaenner.github.io/disabilitymeasures/contact)

#### You created a new measure and you want people to use it  
If you created a new measures that meets the criteria above, we would be happy to work with you to disseminate your measure on disabilitymeasures.org. If you don't have a website to host the measure or materials, [email us](https://mjmaenner.github.io/disabilitymeasures/contact) and we can host it directly.

#### A post needs to be updated, there was a typo, or a link isn't working
*  Do a pull request on [github](https://github.com/mjmaenner/disabilitymeasures). Each measure is in its own sub-folder
*  [email us](https://mjmaenner.github.io/disabilitymeasures/contact)
