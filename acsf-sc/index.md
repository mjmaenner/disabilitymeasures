**Type of Measure:** The Autism Classification System of Functioning: Social Communication (ACSF:SC) is a five-level descriptive system based the World Health Organization’s International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health (ICF). The tool is a way for therapists, teachers, clinicians, and parents to discuss what their child can do when (1) they are performing their best (capacity) and (2) what they typically do (typical performance). The results from this tool can be useful in describing a child's communication abilities and also assist in identifying differences in ability based on environmental and contextual factors.

**Target Population:** Children

**Measurement properties and previous use:** A study was conducted in the development process of this tool. Core characteristics of social communication were ascertained: communicative intent; communicative skills and reciprocity; and impact of environment was measured among 76 participants. Five ACSF:SC levels were created and content-validated across participants. Best capacity and typical performance agreement ratings varied as follows: intrarater agreement on 41 children was кw=0.61 to 0.69 for parents, and кw=0.71 to 0.95 for professionals; interrater agreement between professionals was кw=0.47 to 0.61, and between parents and professionals was кw=0.33 to 0.53.
