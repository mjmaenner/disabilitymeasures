**Type of Measure:**  The Empathy Quotient (EQ) for Adolescents is a parent-report 40-item questionnaire that was designed assess empathy among adolescents with Autism Spectrum Conditions (ASC). The EQ questionnaire is Likert format and contain a list of statements about real life situations, experiences and interests where empathizing abilities are required. On each empathy item, scores range from 0 to 2, so the EQ has a maximum score of 80 and a minimum score of zero. Each empathy item is awarded 1 point if the respondent records the empathic behavior mildly, or 2 points if the respondent records the behavior strongly. The 20 filler items were included to distract the respondent from a relentless focus on empathy.

For both the Adolescent EQ and SQ, parents are asked to
indicate how strongly they agree with each statement about
their child by ticking one of four options: ‘definitely agree’,
‘slightly agree’, ‘slightly disagree’, or ‘definitely disagree’.
Each of the items scores 1 point if the respondent records
the behavior mildly, or 2 points if the respondent records
the behavior strongly. To avoid a response bias, approximately
half the items were worded to produce a ‘‘disagree’’
response and half to produce an ‘‘agree’’ response. The
questionnaires were adapted from the adult and child
versions of the EQ and SQ. Items were revised to be ageappropriate
but kept as close to the Adult and Child versions
as possible, with most questions aimed at the same
behaviors.

A response of ‘slightly agree’ scores one point and ‘definitely
agree’ scores two points on the following items: 1, 3,
11, 13, 14, 15, 21, 22, 24, 26, 27, 28, 29, 34, 35, 36, 38, 39
and 40. A response of ‘slightly disagree’ or ‘definitely
disagree’ scores zero points. ‘Slightly disagree’ scores one
point and ‘definitely disagree’ scores two points on the
following items: 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 12, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 30,
31, 32 and 33. A response of ‘slightly agree’ or ‘definitely
agree’ scores zero points. The maximum score for this
questionnaire is 70.

To avoid response bias, approximately half the items were worded to produce a “disagree” response and half to produce an “agree” response for the empathic response. Items were then randomized. The EQ has a forced choice format, can be self-administered, and does not depend on any interpretation
