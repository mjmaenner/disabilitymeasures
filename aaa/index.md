**Type of Measure:**  (from the [paper](http://docs.autismresearchcentre.com/papers/2006_BCetal_AAA.pdf)): The AAA links two measures together: the Autism Quotient and the Empathy Quotient. Each AAA interview took on average 3 hours, including patient history, background, and to provide feedback on the diagnosis. 

**Target Population:** Adults 

**Measurement properties and previous use:** (summarized from the paper): The authors report that it is more conservative than the corresponding DSM-IV criteria, after being tested on a sample of 42 people attending Asperger syndrome service at a university.

**Languages:** English, German, Spanish, French (possibly others that are not submitted to ARC website).
