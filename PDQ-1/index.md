**Type of Measure:**  The Psychological Development Questionnaire-1 (PDQ-1) is a 10-item parent/caregiver-report questionnaire designed to detect children at-risk for ASD. The PDQ-1 is intended to be a rapid screening instrument and can be used in a variety of settings. The items are designed to represent social interest, referencing, and communication in young children.

**Target Population:** Children aged 18-36 months

**Measurement properties and previous use:** A paper reporting an evaluation of the PDQ-1 described a multi-part study.  In the first phase, the PDQ-1 scores were strongly associated with the Autism Behavior Checklist (-0.869; p<0.001) and PDQ-1 scores were consistent over a 7-day period (0.998). With a screen-positive score set to <=12, the PDQ-1 was 100% concordant with Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised ASD diagnoses.  In a low-risk sample of 2007 screened children, the positive predictive value of the PDQ-1 was 88% (22 of 25 children), however 96% of these children showed >=1 SD expressive or language delays (measured on the Mullen Scales of Early Learning). 1959 of the 2007 children were followed to time 2 and, based on reported autism diagnoses, the PDQ-1 had a sensitivity of 85% (22 of 26). The calculated specificity and NPV were both 99.8%.
