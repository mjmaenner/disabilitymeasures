We want to make it easy to find and share free and high-quality disability measurement tools.

[our goals]
Although we use [objective criteria](https://mjmaenner.github.io/disabilitymeasures/criteria) to decide what measures belong on DisabilityMeasures.org, we do not (at present) provide recommendations about what tools should be used in a given setting.  

[why do this?]
