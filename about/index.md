title: About DisabilityMeasures.org
---

We want to make it easy to find and share free and high-quality disability measurement tools.

[our goals]
Although we use [objective criteria](https://mjmaenner.github.io/disabilitymeasures/criteria) to determine which measures belong on DisabilityMeasures.org, we do not (at present) provide recommendations about what tools should be used in a given setting.  

[why do this?]

[Open collaborations]
In keeping with our goal to lower barriers to research and share information, we've made the entire disaiblitymeasure.org website open source. This makes it much easier for new collaborators to [contribute](https://mjmaenner.github.io/disabilitymeasures/contribute) and, should the need ever arise, anyone may make a copy of the entire site.
