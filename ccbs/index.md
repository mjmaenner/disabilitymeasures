**Type of Measure:** The Child’s Challenging Behavior Scale is a tool that measure’s a mother’s rating of her school aged child’s behaviors that are challenging. The scale assists professionals in identifying family situations who may be in need of more support and interventions. The scale contains eleven items in the form of statements (1= strongly agree, 2= agree, 3= neither agree or disagree, 4= disagree, 5= strongly disagree). 

**Target Population:** Mothers with school aged children with disabilities, aged 5 to 18 years old

**Measurement properties and previous use:** Psychometric evaluation of the tool was conducted using a sample of Victorian mothers with school aged children with disabilities (N=152). The Cronbach alpha was found to be 0.89, indicating excellent internal consistency. Additionally, after running tests of normality, the scale was found to be normally distributed with a mean score of 34.4 and standard deviation of 9.3 (range: 11 to 54). [Bourke-Taylor, H. M., Howie, L., & Law, M., 2010]( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20047597).
