**Type of Measure:**   (Via [CFCS Materials](http://cfcs.us/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/CFCS_universal_2012_06_06.pdf)) The purpose of the CFCS is to classify the everyday communication performance of an individual into one of five levels. The CFCS focuses on activity and participation levels as described in the World Health Organization’s (WHO) International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health (ICF).  This measure is analogous and complementary to the [GMFCS](http://disabilitymeasures.org/gmfcs) and [MACS](http://disabilitymeasures.org/macs).

**Target Population:** [communicated by author] children with communication disorders, originally just with cerebral palsy but more recently with children who do not have communication disorder. 

**Measurement properties and previous use:** [Measurement properties described in Hidecker et al 2011].  The interrater reliability of the CFCS was 0.66 between two professionals and 0.49 between a parent and a professional. Professional interrater reliability improved to 0.77 for classification of children older than 4 years. The test–retest reliability was 0.82. This measure is also often used together with the GMFCS and MACS.

**Languages:** [via [CFCS translations page](http://cfcs.us/?page_id=8)] Chinese (Simplified), Chinese (Traditional), Dutch, English, German, Hebrew, Italian, Norwegian-SCPE, Polish, Poruguese (Brazilian), Spanish, Sedish-SCPE, Turkish. A "Universal" version is also available for people with speech impairments and developmental disabilities. Translation guidelines are also available.
