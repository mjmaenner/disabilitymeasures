**Type of Measure:**  The Survey of Wellbeing of Young Children (SWYC) is a comprehensive screening instrument for children under the age of 5 that evaluates cognitive, language, motor, and social-emotional development as well as family risk factors (parental depression, conflict, or substance abuse, and hunger). The SWYC is comprised of several parts, which broadly assess three domains of child functioning: 1) development, 2) emotion/behavior, and 3) family context. Users are encouraged to review the [manual and training resources](https://www.floatinghospital.org/The-Survey-of-Wellbeing-of-Young-Children/Manual-Training-Resources.aspx) prior to use.    

**Target Population:** Children under the age of 5; Age specific forms are available for children ages 1 - 65 months

**Measurement properties and previous use:** Items contained in the SWYC were written and adapted based on previously validated screening tests and expert opinion. It is comprised of the Developmental Milestones Questionnaire, Family Questions Questionnaire, Parent's Observations of Social Interactions (POSI), Baby Pediatric Symptom Checklist (BPSC), Preschool Pediatric Symptom Checklist (PPSC), and two items on parent concern. Developers provide reliability, validity, sensitivity, and specificity information on some or all components of the SWYC, which was based on various psychometric evaluation techniques. Individual measurement properties are discussed in greater detail on each respective instrument's page (see "Link to Measures" below). 

**Languages:** English, Spanish, Burmese, Nepali, and Portuguese (see the [Translation's Page](https://www.floatinghospital.org/The-Survey-of-Wellbeing-of-Young-Children/Translations.aspx)).
