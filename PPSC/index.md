**Type of Measure:**  The Preschool Pediatric Symptom Checklist (PPSC) is an 18-item emotional/behavioral screening instrument that was developed as one component of the [Survey of Wellbeing of Young Children (SWYC)](http://disabilitymeasures.org/SWYC/). The tool was developed to aid pediatricians in the early detection of emotional/behavioral problems for infants and pre-schoolers. Items on the PPSC were developed after an extensive review of relevant measures and literature and consultation with parents of young children and experts in child development.

**Target Population:** Children 18-60 months

**Measurement properties and previous use:** The developers of the PPSC [(Sheldrick et al., 2012)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3907071/) examined the instrument's factor structure and conducted tests of construct validity across three separate samples: 292 families from pediatric primary care practice groups; 354 families from referral clinics; and a replication sample consisting of 171 families from a separate set of pediatric primary care practices.  

Results from an exploratory factor analysis indicated four interpretable subscales: Externalizing, Internalizing, Attention Problems, and Parenting Challenges. The PPSC total score demonstrated strong internal consistency (Primary Care, alpha = 0.88; Referral Clinic, alpha = 0.92; and Replication alpha = 0.86) and retest reliability (alph = 0.75). The tool identifies children who score in the clinical range of a longer, well-validated parent-report instrument (the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL)), as well as children who are reported to have a range of behavioral diagnoses. Moreover, sensitivity and specificity were comparable (consistently above 0.70) to those of another well-accepted but longer screener, the Ages & Stages Questionnaire: Social/Emotional (ASQ:SE). Finally, results for the PPSC’s total scale remained consistent when replicated in an independent sample.
