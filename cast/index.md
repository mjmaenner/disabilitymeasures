**Type of Measure:** The Childhood Autism Spectrum Test, formerly known as the Childhood Asperger’s Syndrome Test is a 37 item parental questionnaire that screens for possible cases of autism spectrum conditions and related social and communication conditions. 

**Target Population:** School aged children aged 4-11

**Measurement properties and previous use:** The tool has been evaluated in several papers and has shown good sensitivity and specificity when using a score cut-point of > 15 (maximum possible score is 31). The positive predictive value is moderate and the test has good validity and has been shown to be reliable. A study done in 2005 showed that the test has good test-retest reliability and that 97% of children did not move between score groups [Williams et.al.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15618262)
