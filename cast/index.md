**Type of Measure:** The Childhood Asperger’s Syndrome is a 37 item parental questionnaire that screens for possible cases of autism spectrum conditions, specifically Asperger’s syndrome and related social and communication conditions. 

**Target Population:** School aged children aged 4-11

**Measurement properties and previous use:** The tool has been evaluated in several papers and has shown good sensitivity and specificity when using a score cut-point of > 15 (maximum possible score is 31). The positive predictive value is moderate and the test has good validity and has been shown to be reliable. A study done in 2005 showed that the test has good test-retest reliability and that 97% of children did not move between score groups [Williams et.al.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15618262)

**Languages:** English and Chinese

None of them are diagnostic: No single score on any of our tests or questionnaires indicates that an individual has an Autism Spectrum Condition (ASC). If you are concerned that you, or a friend or relative, may have ASC, please discuss these concerns with your GP or family doctor or ask the National Autistic Society (NAS) or equivalent charity in your country, for advice.
