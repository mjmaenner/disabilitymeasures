**Type of Measure:** The Motor Imitation Scale is a research tool that assesses motor imitation skills in young children with Autism Spectrum Disorder. The tool consists of 16 single step actions that are modeled by an adult with structured interaction. Half of these items require imitation of actions with objects and the other half require imitation of body movements. Responses are scored on a 3 point scale with “2” being recorded if the child performed the exact imitation and “1” if the child produced an emerging response and “0” if the child failed to imitate. Some of the items in this tool have also been incorporated in the Screening Tool for Autism in Toddlers & Young Children (STAT).

**Target Population:** Children

**Measurement properties and previous use:** There have been two published studies that show the validity of this tool. The first study compared different types of motor imitation in 18 children with autism, 18 children with developmental delay, and 18 normally developing children. The second study investigated concurrent and predictive relations between imitation and other developmental skills within a sample of 26 two-year-old children with autism. The Cronbach’s alpha measured for this tool was 0.90 which indicated good internal consistency. Cohen’s Kappa collapsed across all MIS items and participants was found to be 0.93.
