**Type of Measure:** The Viking Speech Scale is used to classify children’s speech production, specifically the ease at which children can make themselves understood using different methods of communication. The scale has four levels and is ordinal. The four levels include: (1) speech is not affected by motor disorder (2) speech is imprecise but usually understandable to unfamiliar listeners (3) speech is unclear and not usually understandable to unfamiliar listeners out of context (3) no understandable speech. This is useful because cerebral palsy can affect children’s speech and limit their intelligibility.

**Target Population:** Children aged 4 and above

**Measurement properties and previous use:** This tool was developed to classify children’s speech performance for use in cerebral palsy surveillance registers. Inter-rater reliability was moderate to substantial (k > .58 for all comparisons). Test–retest reliability was substantial to almost perfect for all groups (k > .68). Additionally, over 74% of raters found the scale easy or very easy to use. Pennington et al. concluded that the Viking Speech Scale is a reliable tool that can be used to describe the speech performance of children with cerebral palsy. This can be applied through direct observation of children or through case note review.
