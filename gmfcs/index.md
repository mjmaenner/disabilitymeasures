**Type of Measure:**  The Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) is a 5 level classification system that describes the gross motor function of children and youth with cerebral palsy on the basis of their self-initiated movement with particular emphasis on sitting, walking, and wheeled mobility. [via GMFCS homepage](http://www.canchild.ca/en/measures/gmfcs.asp)

The GMFCS measures what children do in their typical settings (performance), not what they are able to do in an ideal environment (capability). The GMFCS is one of the most widely-used classification systems for individuals with cerebral palsy, as it is used in clinical examinations, research, and population-based studies.  The GMFCS is compatible with the [World Health Organization's International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health](http://www.who.int/classifications/icf/en/).

Trained clinicians can evaluate a child's GMFCS level in a matter of minutes. There is also a newly developed [GMFCS Family and Self Report Questionnaire](http://motorgrowth.canchild.ca/en/GMFCS/familyreportquestionnaire.asp), which incorporates parent-report in the determination of a child's GMFCS level.

The CanChild Group has a handy [FAQ](http://motorgrowth.canchild.ca/en/GMFCS/resources/FAQ-GMFCS.pdf) that covers many details.

**Target Population:** Originally for children with cerebral palsy, but has been applied to other conditions. Separate criteria are available for four age groups: 2 to 4 years, 4 to 6 years, 6 to 12 years, and 12 to 18 years.

**Measurement properties and previous use:** The GMFCS has been used in [hundreds of studies](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=gmfcs) (if not more), and has been extensively evaluated--particularly by the CanChild group.

Previous studies have established the reliability in assessing GFMCS levels (kappa=0.75 for children 2-12 years old; Palisano 1997)  The GMFCS is also informative for prognosis of gross motor progress and outcomes and longitudinal gross motor function curves and percentiles have been shown to correspond to GMFCS levels.  (Rosenbaum et al 2002) Also of particular importance is the demonstration of content validity (Palisano et al 2008).  Other groups have also demonstrated the reliability of assessing GMFCS levels through chart review (Benedict et al 2011)



**Languages:** Developed in English, but has been [translated into many languages](http://www.canchild.ca/en/measures/gmfcs_expanded_revised.asp) including Arabic, Czech, Chinese (Simplified), Chinese (Traditional), Danish, Dutch, French, German, Hebrew, Icelandic,Italian, Japanese, Korean, Norwegian, Persian, Portuguese (Brazil), Portuguese (Portugal), Romanian, Russian, Spanish,Swedish, Thai, and Turkish

They even have [guidelines for translation into new languages](http://motorgrowth.canchild.ca/en/GMFCS/resources/CanChild_Guidelines_for_Translation_of_the_GMFCS.pdf)!
