**Type of Measure:** The Sense and Self-Regulation Checklist (SSC) has been developed as a parent/caregiver measure of the comorbid symptoms associated with autism. These symptoms include: include abnormal sensory responses, sleep disruption, gastrointestinal problems, self-injurious behaviors, aggression, and irritability. The checklist is useful in assessing difficulties with early self-regulation milestones in areas of sleep, digestion, self-soothing, attention, and behavior. There are six sensory subdomains (touch-pain, auditory, visual, taste-smell, hyperreactive to noninjurious stimuli, and hyporeactive to injurious stimuli). Items are rated never (0), rarely (1), sometimes (2), or often (3). Domain scores are obtained by summing the individual items.
 
**Target Population:** Children 6 years of age or younger primarily with Autism Spectrum Disorder, but can also be used for children with other disabilities 

**Measurement properties and previous use:** This tool was validated in a study of 265 children under the age of 6 with a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.87. The findings from this study raised the possibility that sensory and self-regulatory difficulties represent a core part of autism. The study also reported two new finding discriminating autism from other groups: (1) multifocal tactile sensory impairment characterized by hyporeactivity to injurious stimuli and hyperreactivity to noninjurious stimuli. Overall the SSC has been shown to be a valid measure of sensory and self-regulatory difficulties for children under the age of six years. Additionally, it can be used as a treatment outcome measure for children with autism. It can also be used to identify patterns of sensory and self-regulatory of sensory and self-regulatory difficulties in young children with other disabilities.
