**Type of Measure:**  The RAADS was designed to address a major gap in screening services for adults with autism spectrum disorders. With the increased prevalence of the condition and the fact that adults are being referred or self-referred for services or diagnosis with increasing frequency, this instrument is a useful clinical tool to assist clinicians with the diagnosis of this growing population of higher functioning individuals in adulthood. [quoted from the open-access article](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3134766)

The RAADS-R is a self-report instrument, however, the authors mention that a clinician might help a participant interpret items if they have difficulty understanding the question.

**Target Population:** Adults judged to have an IQ in the normal range (IQ >=80).

**Measurement properties and previous use:** A validation study was conducted at 9 sites (USA, Canada, England, Australia) and included adult participants (201 ASD and 578 comparisons).  Using a cut-off score of over 65 produced a specificity of 100% (i.e., no one in the comparison group was labeled as having ASD) and a sensitivity of 97% (only 3% of the ASD group did not score over 65).

**Concordance with other diagnostic instruments:** (quoted from article) All ASD subjects met the research diagnostic criteria of each center and had an ADOS module 4 score in the autism range (these were inclusion criteria). SRS-A scales were administered to 69 first-degree relatives of ASD subjects. The concordance rate was 95.59% (all but three scored in the “autism” range)... However, since only 69 subjects were available to complete the SRS-A, further studies are warranted.

[Test-retest reliability was high,](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3134766/table/Tab7/) particularly for the ASD group. The test-retest sample included 30 people; 15 with ASD and 15 comparison.

Four subscales were identified: circumscribed interests, language, sensory motor, and social relatedness.

A study by [Andersen et al](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21327833) describes the properties of the Swedish translation.  The authors of the RAADS-R also published a [pilot study](http://rivaariellaritvo.com/downloads/JADD_paper.pdf) on the original RAADS.

**Language:** English, but a Swedish translation is available. The authors say that others are working on translations to other languages. An [open access paper](href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21327833) by Andersen et al (2011) about the Swedish translation has been published, but the translation is not included in the article.
