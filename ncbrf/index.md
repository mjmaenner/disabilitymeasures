**Type of Measure:**  This tool was designed to assess the behavior of children and adolescents. The assessment has 76 items and three sections. The form takes about 15 minutes to fill out and there is both a teacher and parent version of the form. The assessment is designed to be used with children and adolescents aged 3 to 16. Section 1 consists of a short answer question and Section 2 has ten items that asks about the occurrence of various behaviors and the respondent must rate the child’s behavior on a 3-point scale ranging from 0-not true to 3- completely/always true. Section 3 is a scale of problem behaviors and has 66 items. 

**Target Population:** Children and adolescents

**Measurement properties and previous use:** There have been several studies that looked at the internal consistency of this tool. One study [Aman et. al.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8750075) did an independent factor analyses of parent and teacher ratings and found that internal consistency was high, parent-teacher agreement was satisfactory, and subscales were analogous to the Aberrant Behavior Checklist. The results from another study [Lecavalier et al.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15679190) also supported the construct validity of NCBRF in children and adolescents with ASD.
