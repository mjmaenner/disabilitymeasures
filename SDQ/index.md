**Type of Measure:**  
The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) is a one-page behavioural screening questionnaire that assesses the prosocial behavior and psychopathology of 4-17 year old youth, which may be completed by parents, teachers, or self-report. It exists in several versions to meet the needs of researchers, clinicians and educationalists. Accordingly, the SDQ can be used for screening, as part of a clinical assessment, as a treatment-outcome measure, and as a research tool. It asks about 25 attributes, some positive and others negative; respondents use a 3-point Likert scale to indicate how far each attribute applies to the target child. The 25 items are divided between five scales of five items each, generating scores for emotional symptoms, conduct problems, hyperactivity-inattention, peer problems, and prosocial behavior; all but the last are summed to generate a total difficulties score. Extended versions of the SDQ are available for those interested in psychiatric caseness and the determinants of service use. The extended verions include the 25 core items plus a brief impact supplement that asks whether the respondent thinks that the child or youth has a problem, and if so, inquires further about overall distress, social impairment, burden, and chronicity.

**Target Population:** Youth ages 4 to 17

**Measurement properties and previous use:**  
[Goodman and Scott (1999)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1022658222914) established that correlations between the internalizing and externalizing scales were lower for the SDQ than for the [Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL-Achenbach, 1991)](http://txautism.net/assets/uploads/docs/CBCK-ed-KS-AK.pdf); this finding raises the possibility that the SDQ scales were “purer” and less “contaminated” by one another. Additionally, the study showed that as judged against an interview with parents, the SDQ was significantly better than the CBCL at detecting inattention and hyperactivity and at least as good at detecting internalizing and externalizing problems. Despite its brevity, the SDQ was reportedly is also significantly
better than the CBCL at predicting a clinical diagnosis of a hyperactivity disorder [(Klasen et al., 2000)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s007870070030).
