**Type of Measure:**  Arc’s Self Determination Scale is a self-report measure of self-determination designed for use by adolescents with mild intellectual disabilities and learning disabilities. The tool was designed to assist students in evaluating their beliefs about themselves so that they may work collaboratively with educators and others to identify individual areas of strength and limitations. The scale is subdivided into four conceptually distinct subscales: 1) self and family care, which includes items that measure basic daily living activities; 2) management, which includes items measuring the degree to which students handle their interactions with the environment; 3) recreation activity, which contains items that indicate the youth’s recreational and leisure time activities; and 4) social and vocational activities, which contain items that measure the adolescent’s social involvement and vocational goals, plans, and activities.    

**Target Population:** Adolescents with mild intellectual disabilities and learning disabilities

**Measurement properties and previous use:** Domains and subdomains of the Scale were derived based on information collected from a series of structured interviews with a sample adults/adolescents who had varying degress of intellectual disability (N = 408). The definitional framework for the Scale was evaluated using multiple measures, including an extant survey called the National Consumer Survey (NCS), which evaluated the independence, integration, and productivity of people with developmental disabilities. A series of self-report measures were used to examine each characteristic of self-determination, and a multiple discriminant function analysis was conducted to identify essentiaal characteristics that are important for distinguishing between people with intellectual disability who were self-determined and those who were not.  The sample was divided into two dichotomous groups based on the performance of behaviors generally agreed upon as reflecting self-determination (derived from NCS survey items). Analyses indicated that, on measures of each of the four essential characteristics, there were significant differences between individuals who engaged in behaviors reflecting self-determination and those who did not.
