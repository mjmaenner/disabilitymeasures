**Type of Measure:**  The Communication and Symbolic Behavior Scales - Devevelopmental Profile (CSBS-DP) *Infant/Toddler Checklist* is a one-page measure of early communication and symbolic skills in young children that aims to identify those who have or are at-risk for developing a communication impairment. The Checklist was designed to measure seven language predictors, which include: emotion and use of eye gaze, use of communication, use of gestures, use of sounds, use of words, understanding of words, and use of objects. This checklist can be used independently, or in conjunction with two other CSBS-DP test components (i.e. a four-page follow-up caregiver questionnaire and a behavior sample). **NOTE:**  Only the Infant/Toddler Checklist is free, the other components of the CSBS-DP are non-free.

**Target Population:** Young children (6 to 24 months of age)

**Measurement properties and previous use:** The *Infant/Toddler Checklist* has evidence of concurrent validity with its other two test components (i.e. the caregiver questionnaire and the behavior sample; correlation coefficients range from 0.50 to 0.87), and it has demonstrated test re-test stability over a 4-month testing interval with correlation coefficients ranging from 0.64 to 0.87 (Wetherby, Allen, Cleary, Kublin, & Goldstein, 2002). There is also evidence of a concurrent and predictive relationship between the Checklist and children's receptive and expressive language at 2 years of age. More recent studies [(e.g. Eadie et al., 2010)](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/13682820903277944) also suggest that the *Infant Toddler Checklist* is a valid clinical tool for measuring constructs broadly representing social, speech, and symbolic communication skills.
