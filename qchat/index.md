**Type of Measure:** The Quantitative Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (Q-CHAT) is a tool that allows for autism spectrum disorder to be detected in toddlers 18-24 months of age. The measure consists of 25 likert-type items, scored on a five point scale (0-4). The scale describes measures a child may or may not engage in. The tool is a modified version of the Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (CHAT) that was developed in 2001 as a measure that helped healthcare professionals “red flag” for further diagnostics. Unlike the CHAT, the Q-CHAT contains items on language development, social communication, and repetitive behaviors.

**Target Population:** Toddlers ages 18-24 months old

**Measurement properties and previous use:** There have been several studies that have utilized the Q-CHAT. [Allison et. al](http://docs.autismresearchcentre.com/papers/2008_Allison_etal_QCHAT.pdf) states that the intraclass correlation
for test-retest reliability was 0.82 (n = 330). Overall, the study showed that the Q-CHAT is useful in the early identification of the threshold and subthreshold features of autism. The 2012 Q-CHAT-10 study, [Allison et. al.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22265366) showed that at a cut-point of 3 , sensitivity was 0.91, specificity was 0.89, and PPV was 0.58. Additionally, internal consistency was >0.85.
