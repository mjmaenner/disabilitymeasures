One of the major motivations for creating disability measures was in response to the paucity of freely available tools for the assessment and diangosis of autism.  Here, we present a curated list of free tools that are *relevant* to autism:

#### Autism symptoms: including screening and diagnosis

  * [Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers](http://disabilitymeasures.org/m-chat)
  * [Autism Quotient](http://disabilitymeasures.org/aq)
* Children

* Adults
  * [Adult Asperger Assessment (AAA)](http://disabilitymeasures.org/aaa)
  * [Autism Quotient](http://disabilitymeasures.org/aq)
