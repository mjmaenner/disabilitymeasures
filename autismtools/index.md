title: Autism-specific tools
---

One of the major motivations for creating disability measures was in response to the paucity of freely available tools for the assessment and diangosis of autism.  Here, we present a curated list of free tools that are *relevant* to autism:

#### Autism symptoms: Screening and Diagnosis
* Toddlers
  * [Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers](http://disabilitymeasures.org/m-chat)
* Children
* Adults
  * [Adult Asperger Assessment (AAA)](http://disabilitymeasures.org/aaa)

<br>

#### Activity Limitations
* Toddlers
* Children
* Adults
  * [Waisman Activities of Daily Living (W-ADL) Scale](http://disabilitymeasures.org/w-adl)
