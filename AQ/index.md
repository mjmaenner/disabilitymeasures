**Type of Measure:**  The Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ) is a 50-item self-report questionnaire that assesses the presence of autistic traits in adults with normal intelligence. The AQ is reportedly a valuable instrument for rapidly quantifying where any given
individual is situated on the continuum from autism to normality. Items on the AQ broadly reflect the following domains: social skills, attention switching, attention to detail, communication, and imagination.    

**Target Population:** Adults 

**Measurement properties and previous use:** The AQ developers [report](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1005653411471) that the AQ has 1) reasonable face validity, as indicated by higher scores among people with a diagnosis involving autistic traits; 2) reasonable construct validity, as indicated by moderate to high internal consistency coefficients for each of the 5 subdomains; and 3) excellent test-retest reliability (r. = 0.70).
