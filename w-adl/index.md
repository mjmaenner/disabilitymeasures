*Type of Measure*:  Parent- or caregiver-report survey of activities of daily living. Contains 17 items, each item is rated as 0=”does not do”, 1=”does with help”, or 2=”does independently / on own”. Takes approximately 5 minutes

*Target Population*: Adolescents and adults with intellectual or developmental disabilities (including autism, Down syndrome, fragile X syndrome, and intellectual disability of unknown etiology).

*Measurement properties and previous use*: The measurement properties of the W-ADL weresystematically evaluated (paper) in long-running longitudinal studies of adolescents and adults with Autism, Down syndrome, fragile X syndrome, and intellectual disability of unknown etiology.  The evaluation found that the W-ADL met or exceeded a-priori thresholds for content validity, internal consistency, criterion validity, construct validity, reproducibility, responsiveness, floor/ceiling effects, and interpretability.

A poster/handout of the main findings of the paper is also available.  Another paper examining longitudinal change in W-ADL scores for individuals with autism and Down syndrome can be found here.

*Language*: English, but each item is only a few words. Please contact the authors if you are interested in contributing a translated version of the W-ADL.
